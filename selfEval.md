# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? 

Today I started off completing some assigments from yesterday. Last night I felt very stuck and at 11pm, after working on one particular problem for an hour, and headed to bed. When I got up at 6am the todady I was able to complete that problem that I was stuck on in under 10 minutes. That was a really important reminder to me that my brain needs to be rested in order to learn and process information. I'm still feeling like I need a lot more help with functions but I have made tremendous progress today, going from not understanding much to having a basic understanding of the notes. 

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications? 

Functions enable us to re-use code where it is defined, removing the need to repeat it over and over again in the same application.
